# Cars

In search of finding a good deal on a used car, I have created this API + Discord Bot which scrapes craigslist and sends a message of new listings.  
Technologies used (so far): Express, Puppeteer, Discord.js  
Technologies to be used later: Redis, Typescript, React Native (Web)  
I do not plan on hosting this publically because I don't want to send a lot of requests to Craigslist
